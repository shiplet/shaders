# Shaders
In general I work from the single `learning.fs` file. Additional branches exist for lessons & experiences I've found to be particularly educational.

### Getting started
I use the excellent `glslViewer` and `sublime-glslViewer` tools created by [patriciogonzalezvivo](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo) for live-coding these exercises.
- [`glslViewer`](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer)
- [`sublime-glslViewer`](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/sublime-glslViewer)

The repos also contain pertinent documentation and usage guidelines.

After you've installed those packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/shiplet/shaders.git
cd shaders
glslViewer learning.fs
```

Then open `learning.fs` in Sublime and you're good to go! The `glslViewer` will update every time you save the file.
